// Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winnerâ€™s score and logs a winner announcement.

//now i need a function that will compare the human and machine's choice. Whoever is the winner of that round will get a point, which will be incremented to one of the two variables: humanScore or computerScore

/*
1. get the computer choice, store it in a variable
2. get the human choice, store it in a variable
3. create a conditional construct to compare the two values
   1. if human choice and computer choice are equal, draw
   2. if human choice is rock:
      1. if computer choice is paper, computer wins
      2. if computer choice is scissors, human wins
   2. if human choice is paper:
      1. if computer choice is rock, human wins
      2. if computer choice is scissors, computer wins
   3. if human choice is scissors:
      1. if computer choice is rock, computer wins
      2. if computer choice is paper, human wins
4. if draw, no one gets a point
5. if human wins, humanScore variable incremented by one
6. if machine wins, machineScore incremented by one
